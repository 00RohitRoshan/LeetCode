`One way to optimize the given code for better performance is to pre-compute the number of plates between each pair of candles in the string s and store the results in an array. This can be done in O(m) time, where m is the length of the string s. Then, for each query, you can use the pre-computed results to find the number of plates between the candles in the given range in O(1) time. This will reduce the time complexity of processing all queries from O(n * m) to O(n + m), where n is the number of queries.`
